			COVID-19 is a respiratory condition caused by a coronavirus.Some people are infected but don't notice any symptoms.Most people will have mild symptoms and get better on their own.But about 1 in 6 will have severe problems, such as trouble breathing. The odds of more serious symptoms are higher if you're older or have another health condition like diabetes or heart disease.
		</p>
		
		<h3> Common Symptoms </h3>

			<li>Children tend to have abdominal symptoms and skin changes or rashes.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>
			Note:-Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19
		</p>

		<h3> Emergency Symptoms </h3>

		<p> 
			Call a doctor or hospital right away if you have one or more of these COVID-19 symptoms:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Trouble breathing</li>		
			<li>Constant pain or pressure in your chest</li>
			<li>Bluish lips or face</li>
			<li>Sudden confusion</li>
		</ul>

		<h3> Other COVID-19 Symptoms </h3>

		<p> 
		COVID-19 can also cause problems including:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Pinkeye</li>
			<li>Swollen eyes</li>
			<li>Fainting</li>
			<li>Guillain-Barre syndrome</li>
			<li>Coughing up blood</li>
			<li>Blood clots</li>
			<li>Seizures</li>
			<li>Heart problems</li>
			<li>Kidney damage</li>
			<li>Liver problems or damage</li>

		</ul>
		
		<p>
			Some doctors are reporting rashes tied to COVID-19, including purple or blue lesions on children's toes and feet. Researchers are looking into these reports so they can understand the effect on people who have COVID-19.
		</p>

		<h3>Symptoms in Children</h3>

		<p> 
		Researchers say kids have many of the same COVID-19 symptoms as adults, but they tend to be milder. Common symptoms in children include:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Fever: 56%</li>
			<li>Cough: 54%</li>
			<li>Shortness of breath: 13%</li>

		</ul>
		
		<p>
			Some children and teens who are in the hospital with the disease have an inflammatory syndrome that may be linked to the new coronavirus. Doctors call it pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PMIS). Symptoms include a fever, a rash, belly pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and heart problems. It's similar to toxic shock or to Kawasaki disease, a condition in children that causes inflammation in blood vessels.
		</p>

		<h3>How to Check for Fever</h3>

		<p> 
		Your regular body temperature may be higher or lower than someone else's. It also changes throughout the day. Doctors generally consider a fever in an adult to be anything over 100.4 F on an oral thermometer and over 100.8 F on a rectal thermometer.
		</p>

		<p> 
		If you think you've come into contact with the virus, or if you have symptoms, isolate yourself and check your temperature every morning and evening for at least 14 days. Keep track of the readings. A fever is the most common symptom of COVID-19, but it's sometimes below 100 F. In a child, a fever is a temperature above 100 F on an oral thermometer or 100.4 F on a rectal one
		</p>
		
		<h3>Is Covid the same in everyone?</h3>

		<p> 
		No. The coronavirus can affect multiple organs and has several less common symptoms.
			
			<br><br>

		Scientists using data on the health of four million people say Covid has six sub-types.

		</p>

		<h5> Symptoms include:</h5>

		<ul class="ul_fever">
		
			<li><dl><dt>Flu-like with no fever:  </dt>
				<dd>Headache, loss of smell, muscle pains, cough, sore throat, chest pain, no fever</dd></dl></li>
			
			<li><dl><dt>Flu-like with fever:  </dt>
				<dd>Headache, loss of smell, cough, sore throat, hoarseness, fever, loss of appetite</dd></dl></li>
			
			<li><dl><dt>Gastrointestinal: </dt>
				<dd>Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, sore throat, chest pain, no cough</dd></dl></li>
			
			<li><dl><dt>Fatigue (severe level one): </dt>
				<dd> Headache, loss of smell, cough, fever, hoarseness, chest pain, fatigue</dd></dl></li>
			
			<li><dl><dt>Confusion (severe level two):  </dt>
				<dd>Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, cough, fever, hoarseness, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain</dd></dl></li>
			
			<li><dl><dt>Abdominal and respiratory (severe level three): </dt>
				<dd>Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, cough, fever, hoarseness, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, abdominal pain</dd></dl></li>
			
			
		</ul>
	
		<p> 
		NOTE:- Researchers think that vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps could be a sign of coronavirus infection in children.
		</p>
		
		<h3>If I have a cough, is it definitely Covid?</h3>
		
		<p> 
			Lots of other viruses have similar symptoms to Covid, including flu and other infections. This will be a particular problem over winter when these bugs are more common.
		</p>
	
		<h5> What Kind of Cough Is Common?</h5>
		
		<p>
			Early studies have found that at least 60% of people with COVID-19 have a dry cough. About a third have a cough with mucus, called a "wet" or "productive" cough.
		</p>

		<h3>What Does Shortness of Breath Feel Like?</h3>

		<img class="family" src="bin/symptoms/images/family.png" align="right" border="5">

		<p>
			Dyspnea is the word doctors use for shortness of breath. It can feel like you:
		</p>
		
		<ul class="ul_family">
			<li>Have tightness in your chest</li>
			<li>Can't catch your breath</li>
			<li>Can't get enough air into your lungs</li>
			<li>Can't breathe deeply</li>
			<li>Are smothering, drowning, or suffocating</li>
			<li>Have to work harder than usual to breathe in or out</li>
			<li>Need to breathe in before you're done breathing out</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Is It COVID-19, the Flu, a Cold, or Allergies?</h3>

		<p>
		Since they share so many symptoms, it can be hard to know which condition you have. But there are a few guidelines that can help.
		</p>

		<p>
		You may have COVID-19 if you have a fever and trouble breathing, along with the symptoms listed above.
		</p>

		<p>
		If you don't have problems breathing, it might be the flu. You should still isolate yourself just in case.
		</p>

		<p>
		It's probably allergies if you don't have a fever but your eyes are itchy, you're sneezing, and you have a runny nose.
		</p>

		<p>
		If you don't have a fever and your eyes aren't itchy, it's probably a cold.
		</p>

		<p>
		Call your doctor if you're concerned about any symptoms. COVID-19 can range from mild to severe, so it may be hard to diagnose. Testing could be available in your area.
